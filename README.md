Random scripts that I have on my Arch Linux system. Might update periodically in the future.

These are mainly kept here for archival purposes, so some scripts might not be very useful to others. For example swap-lang.sh swaps my system language between English and Greek, but I doubt many people would find that useful, like ever, except for people like me.
